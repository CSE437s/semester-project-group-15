Errors we got while creating the history feature(*all resolved):
1. 10.20.0 - [FirebaseFirestore][I-FST000001] AppCheck failed: 'The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. The attestation provider DeviceCheckProvider is not supported on current platform and OS version.'
2. Error saving test history: Missing or insufficient permissions.
3. 10.20.0 - [FirebaseFirestore][I-FST000001] WriteStream (106f323c8) Stream error: 'Permission denied: Missing or insufficient permissions.'
4. 10.20.0 - [FirebaseFirestore][I-FST000001] Write at users/DUnBD1k93QQK528iwwku3CWuKqH3/testHistory/nzFkEfZ8xShAEyzr495r failed: Missing or insufficient permissions.
How to resolve above errors:
*1*   i. try use an actual device(not the Xcode simulator)
    ii. If URL is shown in the error, probably need to go to the cloud conlose to enable something.
        Configure DeviceCheck on the Apple Developer Portal:
            Go to the Apple Developer Portal.
            Navigate to "Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles".
            Select "Identifiers" and then your app's identifier.
            Ensure that "DeviceCheck" is enabled for your app identifier. If it's not, edit the identifier settings to enable it.
        Set up DeviceCheck in Firebase:
            Go to the Firebase Console.
            In the "App Check" section, go to App, and set the DeviceCheck and/or App Attest (App Attest worked this time)

*2,3,4*  i. check the rules, matches the collection names, etc. debug it.
